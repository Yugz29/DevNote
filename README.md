## 📖 About

**DevNote** addresses a common developer problem: **scattered information**. Code snippets, terminal commands, technical notes, and TODOs often end up fragmented across multiple tools, making it hard to find what you need when you need it.

DevNote provides a single platform to:
- 📝 Store technical notes and documentation
- 💻 Save reusable code snippets
- ✅ Manage project-specific TODOs
- 🔍 Search instantly across your knowledge base
- 🌐 Access everything from any device
